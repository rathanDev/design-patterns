# Design Patterns

- Proven solutions for specific problems 
- categorized under 3 sub types. 
    Creational  (Factory, Singleton, Builder)
    Structural  (Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
    Behavioural (Command, Observer)

Adapter
Makes incompatible interfaces compatible, without modifying the code

Builder 
Creates objects with large number of attributes
Lombok plugin provides builder out of the box

Command 
Decouples the object that invokes the operation from the object that performs the action (Switch, TurnOnCommand)

Decorator
Adds new responsibilities or behaviors

Facade
Hides the complexities of the system by providing a simpler interface.

Factory
Creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client

Observer
Specifies communication between objects
